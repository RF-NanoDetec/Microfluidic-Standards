# Microfluidic Chip Simulator Refactoring Plan

## Completed Tasks
1. Port Helper Refactoring
   - Created `addChipPorts` helper function to standardize port creation
   - Implemented `setupPortVisualsAndLogic` for consistent port behavior
   - Updated all chip creation functions to use the new port helpers

2. Channel Drawing Refactoring
   - Created `createChannelLine` helper for consistent channel styling
   - Implemented `addStraightChannel`, `addXChannel`, `addTChannel`, `addMeanderChannel`
   - Standardized channel visualization across all chip types

3. Base Component Structure
   - Created `createBaseChip` helper for consistent chip creation
   - Standardized shadow effects and visual styling
   - Implemented consistent component border handling

## In Progress
1. Component Creation Refactoring
   - Need to review and standardize component creation functions
   - Consider creating a factory pattern for component creation
   - Ensure consistent attribute setting across components

2. Flow Visualization System
   - Current implementation mixes concerns between simulation and visualization
   - Need to separate flow calculation from visualization logic
   - Consider creating dedicated visualization module

## Planned Tasks
1. Code Organization
   - Split large app.js into modules
   - Create separate files for:
     - Component definitions
     - Simulation engine
     - Visualization system
     - UI management
     - Event handlers
     - Utility functions

2. Simulation Engine Improvements
   - Separate network graph building from solving
   - Create dedicated classes for network nodes and segments
   - Improve error handling and validation

3. UI System Modernization
   - Create proper component hierarchy
   - Implement state management system
   - Separate UI logic from component logic

4. Testing Infrastructure
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for component interaction
   - Add visual regression testing

5. Documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments for all functions
   - Create architectural documentation
   - Add user documentation

## Technical Debt
1. Inconsistent Variable Naming
   - Some variables use camelCase, others use snake_case
   - Need to standardize naming conventions

2. Duplicate Code
   - Similar channel drawing logic in different components
   - Repeated port setup code

3. Global State
   - Many functions rely on global variables
   - Need to encapsulate state management

4. Error Handling
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Missing error boundaries in critical sections

## Next Steps
1. Complete the component creation refactoring
2. Begin separation of simulation and visualization logic
3. Start modularizing the codebase
4. Implement proper state management

## Notes
- Keep track of breaking changes
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all major architectural decisions
- Regular code reviews needed
